# Gamerz-Market

# Motivation 
* The purpose of Gamerz Market is to be an open marketplace for everyone who likes or is interested in video games. Our aim is to make transactions of video games more feasible and economical. 
* What makes us different? We allow users to get in touch with each other, so that they can reach a deal between themselves for the brand new/pre-owned games they want to sell/buy.
* With Gamerz Market, you’ll be able to sell your old video game collection to someone who wants it and make good money, or better invest it into more video games! 
* Gamers hate it when a video game isn’t cross-platform or the fact that they can’t find a game version of their console therefore, we offer a game library with Xbox, PS4 and PC compatibility. 

# What Gamerz Market has to offer? 
* A guest user can browse video games and filter their search based on their console and video game condition i.e. brand new or pre-owned.
* An account holder is able to post ads on the website as well as, contact other users in order to purchase their games that are on the market. 
* When a user has an account with us, we have their personal information on consent from them, so that in a case where something goes wrong, we know who to report and who to kick out from the Gamerz community.
